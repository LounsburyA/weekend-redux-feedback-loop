# Project Feedback loop


## Description


For this assignment, I created a reflection/feedback form modeled after Prime's system. Feedback will be collected over 4 views. In a separate review page, display the current feedback values and a submit button. When all steps are complete, the app will save the feedback in the database. 

Challenges 

Creation of a Next button the brought user to the next page.  This was done using history.push and the appropriate url for the next page.  I also struggled for a while figuring out how to bundle my data to post it.  Which was completed by putting the necessary data in an object. Creating a new form for each component was another challenge but they ended up being very similar as a result once one component was complete the rest were easy to complete.
